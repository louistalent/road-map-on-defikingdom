                            the battlefield.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight">Dragons</span> are the most powerful, wealthy, and confident

                            They have the strength to snag and carry and enemies off the battlefield, but at the same
                            time resort to their strategic tactics more often than not by breathing fire from a
                            distance.
                            <br />
                            Much like their ancestors, the <span class="green-highlight">DragonBloods</span> wield an
                            astonishing amount of strength.<br />
                            Their attacks are cause tremendous damage so proceed to attack <span
                                class="green-highlight">Dragonbloods</span> carefully. <br />
                            Along with their increased total damage, <span class="green-highlight">DragonBloods</span>
                            have the power of fire running through their veins.<br />
                            This allows <span class="green-highlight">DragonBloods</span> to call on their ancestors
                            during battle and have a unique ticking fire damage on their attacks. However, the arrogance
                            of the <span class="green-highlight">dragon</span> is often it’s downfall.<br />
                            Critical damage resistance and damage resistance is decreased due to the tendency of <span

                            of time.
                            <br />
                            The reason behind it is simple.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight"> Bears</span> are the most courageous, spiritual, and
                            instinctive creatures on this planet.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight"> Bears</span> wield the power to rip apart most land animals,
                            however they only do it when their instincts kick in.
                            <br />
                            And when it does kick in, <span class="green-highlight"> Bears</span> will stop at nothing
                            to make sure them and their cubs are safe.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight">BearBloods</span> have this same warrior instincts instilled
                            in their blood.
                            <br />
                            They fear nothing and trust that their instincts and courage will carry them to victory.
                            <br />
                            The strong connection to their spirit has carried them this far into the war so why would it
                            fail them now? Due to their connection with the spirits and their own instincts, <span
                                class="green-highlight">bearbloods</span> are born with an increased number of stamina
                            and health.
                            <br />
                            They can summon their inner spirit for increased critical damage and increased total damage.
                            <br />
                            However, <span class="green-highlight">Bears</span> are the slowest bloodline left, so they
                            do lack more attack speed than others.
                            <br />
                            They also have lower magic resistance since their instincts and spirits

                            The <span class="green-highlight">wolf</span> is the smallest, least dominant animal on this
                            list.
                            <br />
                            By themselves at least.
                            <br />
                            Wolves have a unique way of surviving.
                            <br />
                            They live in pacts.
                            <br />
                            Pacts that create a bond where each <span class="green-highlight">wolf</span> is willing to
                            risk his life for the other or the greater good of the pact.
                            <br />
                            This loyalty mixed with their life-or-death mentality is a combination that is destined for
                            great strength.
                            <br />
                            Add in the fact that they know when to cut their losses and retreat, then you can see while
                            they lasted this long.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight">Wolfbloods</span> carry this same mentality with them, they
                            travel and fight for their pact and do not make decisions that will do more harm than good.
                            <br />
                            Wolves are fast and swift which is why <span class="green-highlight">Wolfbloods</span> get
                            an increased amount of attack speed, and wolves can call on their pact which increases
                            defense, gains health, and increases attack damage 3x.
                            <br />
                            Since wolves try to be quick and easy, they have less damage resistance, possess less attack
                            damage per attack, and they have less total health.

                            <span class="green-highlight">Lions</span> possess the strength to go head-to-head with any
                            animal, along with grace and finesse to chase any animal down in any terrain.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight">Lions</span> are just absolute killing machines and control
                            the Sahara.

                            As if a tiger’s physical abilities don’t present a big enough problem by themselves, tigers
                            approach every encounter with respect.
                            <br />
                            This allows for the <span class="green-highlight">lions</span> to scale their surroundings
                            carefully and wait for the perfect time to attack.
                            <br />
                            This makes <span class="green-highlight">lions</span> the most lethal animal on this planet.
                            <br />
                            The <span class="green-highlight">LionBloods</span> took this mentality from their ancestors
                            and brought it to war.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight">LionBloods</span> are extremely balanced in warfare, not too
                            slow, not too weak, nor do they enter a situation without preparation.
                            <br />
                            <span class="green-highlight">LionBloods</span> gain boosts in damage, stamina,
                            intelligence, and total health.
                            <br />
                            They also call onto their ancestors to give them a massive boost in attack speed and
                            critical chance hit.
                            <br />
                            However, <span class="green-highlight">Lionbloods</span> have the lowest amount of magic and

                            The power they have, the authority they have, the independence they have.
                            <br />
                            The power of <span class="green-highlight">sharks</span> is what makes them so feared, they
                            are the rulers of the ocean.
                            <br />
                            Along with a bite and razor-sharp teeth that can tear through anything in its path.

                            <span class="green-highlight">Sharks</span> can roam the ocean alone and still be

                            They have controlled their domain, and answer to no one.

                            <span class="green-highlight">Sharks</span> completely rule the ocean.
                            <br />
                            Much is why <span class="green-highlight"> Sharkbloods</span> answer to no one on Earth as

                            They have lived for this moment.
                            <br />
                            The moment to prove that they have always been the best warrior.

                            They also gain a bleeding damage over time affect from their ancestor’s razor-sharp teeth.

                            They also have good fire resistance, but their damage resistance falls lower on the ranks,
